Wow. 

I read up on this "rebellious teenager phase" but I've never expect this stage to be so challenging. 

It seems like this stage typically begins at around 6 month old, and might only end at around 18 month old. I was chatting with another owner on IG on this topic and both of us wish that our furball will get over this stage by 12 month old or earlier.

Is it really that challenging? **The answer is yes.**

There are many resources discussing about this "adolescence phase". Here are two video resources:

- [Zak George's How to Train a Dog During the "Rebellious" Phase!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4EIFUbmEtLw)

This post is not meant to discuss about adolescene phase. I just wanted to write this post so that I can come back again to reflect some of the things that I've done to deal with his adolescene period. This might give a different insight to potential dog owners as this period is really very very very hard to deal with.

## Potty Accident Again!?

It was right after he had officially recovered from the neutering operation when he started to be very destructive at home. At first, I thought he was just throwing tanrums for wearing the shame of cone for 2 weeks but his behaviours become worse as time goes by.

He was only given the liberty to go to the living room after he learned that he has to go back to our room for potty. Who knows he started to do his businesses on the sofa after not having any potty accident for more than a month. This happened for at least 2-3 times after the recovery. He does a very crazy zoomie-like ritual before pooping on the sofa so it's definitely intentional.

I realise I can only give him access to the living room after he has done his businesses in the room. Consistency is the key... We managed to solve this problem within a week or two.

**That's not all about it *hor***.

## Play biting again?!

For some reasons, he started to play bite again. He stopped for a while and this behaviour came back recently. I don't have picture/video to show since most of the time when he's chewing on my hands I will have to train him immediately.

I am ok for Tamago to play bite but I am not ok if the bites started to get very hard. His bites can be quite hard when he gets very excited so this is something I'm trying to correct him. He tends to jump and chew on my hands sometimes when he gets really excited.

Apart from that, I am very afraid that such behaviour is a precursor to aggressive behaviour. So far, he does not growl and his body language does not seem stiff. His tongue is relax (sometimes tilt) and his eyes are very playful. Even so, I think it will be good to correct this behaviour as the kids in my house might not know how to deal with this kind of rough play.

## Digging everything?!

He doesn't really dig when he was younger so this comes as a surprise. He started to dig my tv console, door, wardrobe and pee tray.

*This pee tray is really good in terms of the depth... but too bad it does not have secure lock.*

It happens that I've upgraded his pee tray to a larger size... and this pee tray did not have a secure lock. Hence, he managed to pry the cover and took out the pee pad after I leave for work one morning.

*The rest is history...*

*Bits and pieces of pee pad everywhere*

I tried to tape the end of the pee tray but it was to no avail. So.. he ended up with a new medium pee tray that comes with secure lock. **If it can be solved by money, it shall be solved by money.**

## Chewing on Furniture

Shortly after, he started to chew on the funiture in our room. He does this when he was younger because he's teething badly. I wasn't expecting this behaviour to continue after he has dropped most of his baby teeth.

He started with my tv console. I was away for about 6 hours and he was allowed to roam in a small area in the room. At that point of time, he was still having his baby molar so he couldn't really "chew off" the bits from the console. I thought that he was teething and bored so I didn't give too much thought into this.

Then, he moved on to my wardrobe. It started with a small corner and it eventually ended up like this. I tried to use a plank wood to cover the damage at the bottom but it doesn't work that well.

I didn't have much solution... so I decided to block his access from that corner of the wardrobe. He managed to chew off the corner of the wood and swallow some wood splinters. Luckily, he was able to pass them out successfully.

Of course, this is not the end. He went to destroy my door instead. He managed to chew off the corner... and my door is now topped with his chew mark.

Who knows... after I blocked access to the door, he went back to the tv console. This time, he managed to chew off the wood and swallow the splinters. I can see them in his poo...

I tried to use the makeover sheet to paste over the places that he has chewed. But he has the tendency to return to the same place to satisfy his chewing activity. This solution does not work as he's somehow able to dig and peel off the makeover sheet.

## So what's the solution?!

At the point of writing, I've no solution to stop Tamago from chewing the furniture. He does listen to "leave it", and he does "leave it" when I requested him to stop. However, he will go back again after a few minutes and the cycle has to be repeated.

I wouldn't mind doing this for many times if I've my full attention on him. But it's impossible for me to supervise Tamago for 24/7.

The quickest solution (in my opinion) is to put him back into the playpen again. He used to be in the playpen when he was younger. I let my guards down and let him roam freely in my room when he's potty trained. Now that he's back to his rebellious stage, I think I have to take a step back and remove his rights to roam in the room freely.

He was a bit restless in the beginning but he managed to settle after a few days. These days, he can fall asleep quite easily in the playpen.

## What's next?

I was too complacent and have let my guard down. Many veteran trainers have warned that we shouldn't be giving our dogs too much freedom in the first year. I thought that he has been behaving very well until all the chewing incidents happened. 

What I can do now is to just take a step back and train Tamago from the basic again. I can wish for the best dog but things might not be the way I wish for if I don't execute. This starts from putting him back to playpen again and force him to take a nap. In addition, I will be purchasing some snuffle mat or treats dispenser to keep his mental busy when I cannot supervise him.

Anyway, he has grown taller and stronger. I've upgraded his PVC playpen to a sturdier metal playpen as he has been able to jump-push open the PVC fences.

I've also blocked access to the tv console, wardrobe and door using the PVC fences. Hopefully this has covered all the places he has tried to chew on and he will stop ingesting wood splinters...

As usual, end off with a cute picture of Tamago :)
