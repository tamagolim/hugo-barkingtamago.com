## Before Meeting Tamago

Owning a dog is a lifetime commitment. As a dog owner, we are responsible for their life and we have to make all decisions on behalf of the dogs. It is important to understand what we are getting ourselves into before we get a dog. I've spoken to my friends who are dog owners and done an extensive research on dog behaviours before I search for a dog. Here are the areas that I've studied:

- Breed: Personality and behaviours
- Price: Local vs Imported vs Adoption
- Daily Care: Food, water, medical, exericse, treats, environment, grooming,
- Dog training methodologies: Force-free/positive reinforcement, punishments, using of tools

### Adoption vs Purchase

There are many advocates of #adoptdontshop. Many asked why I choose to support the pet shop instead of adopting from the shelter. 

As much as I would love to provide a forever home for rescue dogs, I did not want to take any risk as I'm a first-time dog owner. Given that I've zero experience in handling a dog, I don't think I am ready to train a rescue dog. In addition, there are children in my family that I would need to consider. What if I adopted a dog that has behaviorial issues with the kids and elderly in my family? After following some stories on IG, I firmly believe that I've made a right choice not adopt for my first dog.

### Breed & Temperament

Rather than choosing a breed, I'm looking for a small dog that doesn't shred much with medium level energy level. This helps to narrow down to two breeds.

- West Highland White Terrier (Westie)
- Yorkshire Terrier (Yorkie)

### Scouting for Pet Shop(s)

The key idea is to scout for a pet shop that is well-maintained, clean and "responsible". I used Instagram to find shops and read reviews on Facebook pages to ensure that I'm not getting a dog from dubious breeders.

I found [Shake-A-Paw](https://www.instagram.com/shakeapawsg/?hl=en) on IG and she happened to have Yorkies arriving in November 2020. The reviews are all positives. When I visited the shop, it's very obvious that she has put in a lot of effort to maintain the place. The crates are very clean and there is hardly any dog smell in the shop. Her dogs were roaming in the shop and the puppies are giving sufficient space in the crate. Overall, I felt very comfotable when I was in the shop.

## Meeting Tamago for the First Time

My friends told me that it's all about the connection you have with the puppy at the first sight. I totally agree with what they said. It's really hard to describe... perhaps something like love at first sight? It's as though there is a compatibility index.

There were 3 yorkies and 1 of them was already reserved by another owner. He caught my eyes immediately the moment I stepped into shop. He's not the most active puppy among the 3 yorkies but somehow we connected when we had eye contact.

I made my decision within 30 minutes. It's just as simple as that.

Unfortunately, I didn't take any picture when I decided on him. I was too excited over the fact that I'm going to be a dog owner soon! Here's the post that the shop has posted. Tamago's the second Yorkie that appeared in the video.

## Preparation

Before bringing Tamago home, it is essential to puppy-proof my room so that he has a safe space to play, eat and sleep as he will be sleeping in my room. I've a relatively big room (old HDB flat) so I was able to cordon an area for him.

I used to think that it's cruel to confine a dog in the crate. After watching a few videos online and reading up on crate training, I am convinced that crate training is very important for both the owner and the dog. I don't think I will be able to supervise Tamago 24/7 and it will be important for him to recognise a safe space so that he can sleep or play in it.

### Pee Tray

I was not intending to grass-train Tamago as I don't think I will have the time to bring him down for potty (at least more than 5 times for puppy) every day. There are owners who toilet train their dogs too and I think it's definitely much more convenient if they can do their businesses on the toilet floor. However, Tamago is going to live in my room. This means that he needs to learn how to open the door first before he can go to the toilet for potty.

With these reasons, I decided to train him to potty on pee pad.

### Playpen

I wanted to do a playpen so that he can continue to play with his toys in the safer but bigger area when I've to focus on something else at my desk. I was also intending to use the playpen as a "time-out" area when Tamago starts to bite aggressively.

### "Useless" Items

Out of all these items, I regretted getting puzzle play mats and dripless water bottle. I thought it might be useful to create a waterproof space using the puzzle play mat but the liquid sipped through between the mats. It became harder to clean the floor. Furthermore, Tamago started to dig and chew the corner of the mats so it's causing more harm than good. As for the water bottle, it's under utilised as Tamago prefers to drink from the bowl.

## Tamago is here!

Roughly 10 days later, I went back to the store to fetch Tamago! Tamago has already done 2 vaccinations and 3 deworming procedure when I fetch him. I was given a vaccination card that contains the details of his vaccination and deworming procedure. I've also purchased daily care products from the pet shop owner since they have been using those products on him.

- Kibbles
- Canned Food
- Milk replacer
- Ear rinser
- Eye cleaner
- Shampoo

In total, I've paid S$140.11 for these items (with 10% discount). I think it's possible to buy these items cheaper online but I think it's more convenient to get directly from the pet shop first as I slowly experiment other brands.

Apart from this, I've created an account on AVA for the shop owner to transfer ownersnhip under my name. The transfer costs S$13.50. This ownership will be required to renew annually.

### Fussy Eater

I was told that Tamago is a fussy eater as he does not finish his food. Hence, the canned food is supposed to make the kibbles and milk tastier so that he will enjoy his meal. Ever since he comes home, he finishes his food every meal. I removed the canned food after the first round since it's making his face smelly (milk + canned food stuck on his face).

### First night with Tamago

On our first night together, I let him out of the playpen to smell the environment. He doesn't really know what's going on so he just explore around the room and play with his toy. I was watching "Start-up" at that point of time and he was very curious about the "raining" and "thunder" sound from the show. I think this unintentionally started conditioning him to be alright with these two types of sound.

![Roaming around the room](/images/2021-04-02/5.jpg)

There are so many videos and articles talking about how most puppies will cry and whine the entire night. This is because they are brought to an unfamiliar environment... and in some cases they are separated from their mother for the first time. I did not experience any whining and Tamago sleeps through the night LOL. I woke up earlier (~4 or 5am) to let him pee as he can only hold it for a few hours.

### Schedule

I read that it will be good to have a schedule as dogs are very structural creatures. The more structure the day is, the easier it is for dogs to get use to living with the family. 

Using the resources online, I created a schedule that includes potty time, meal time, play time and nap time. I color-coded the row to denote if Tamago has any potty incidents. This helps to retrospect what has gone wrong and progress his potty training. Each row can last between 30-90 minutes depending on the duration that he sleeps before the next activity.

![Strict Schedule](/images/2021-04-02/6.PNG)

After he has hit around 95% potty trained, I slowly let go of this strict schedule. However, he seems to be very accustomed to this structured lifestyle that he still follow the same structure till now (7 months old).

### Food Diary

Apart from the schedule, I've logged down all the new food that he has eaten each day. This is to ensure that we can identify his allergy if he has any allergy reaction. It might seem like a hassle but it really help to track what are the items that might not be suitable for him to munch.

### Training

There are a few commands that are really important for a puppy to learn first. These are the commands that I think it's useful to get Tamago's attention and make him calm down when he gets too excited. Here are the commands that I've taught first:

- Sit
- Down
- Look at me
- Leave it
- Wait

I'm very thankful that I've taught "Look at me" because this command is essentially the basis of other commands. I've used "Look at me" so much when Tamago is causing problems (e.g. chewing furniture) or when he is too excited to get to his food bowl.

## Summary

Tamago might look really cute but he's very playful and cheeky. I tried to film this part of him where he chewed furniture and get overly excited when we are going for a walk to show everyone the reality of having a dog.

Getting a pet is not so easy as "let's get one!" and forget about all the other responsibilities that might come along with. But really, Tamago is a bundle of joy and will always be despite all the destructive things that he has done to my wardrobe and door.
