## Why Crate Training?

When I was child, I vaguely remember that my ex-neighbour confined a puppy in the crate and put it outside of his house. Mind you, we live in HDB flats. This means that the dog has no access to any space apart from his crate. I don't recall my neighbour ever letting the dog out of the crate during that week he was outside the house. The dog cried for a few nights and subsequently disappeared after a week or so.

Due to that incident, my impression on crate is fairly negative. Why should we limit our dog's movement in a confined space when they should be given a grassland to run about? It was only after I started reading on crate training then I know that my impression on crate is incorrect. 

There are many online resources that are discussing about the benefits of crate training. This IG post by Co-op K9 explains has all the key points.

On a selfish note, I wanted to use a crate because I don't think I will be able to keep my cool if I need to supervise him at all times. This has proven right as he started to chew on my furniture during his adolescent stage and it's impossible for me to monitor his activities if I have to work on my own stuffs.

It will be wrong to keep a dog confined in a crate space for a long period of time. I've used a crate + playpen configuration in my room to ensure that Tamago has sufficient space to play with his toys.

## Training Tamago

My primary goal is to ensure that Tamago can sleep and stay in his crate for at least 1-2 hours without any potty accidents when he was still a puppy. I am very fortunate that he does not resist sleeping in the crate.

*He sleeps on my used clothes on the first few nights when his bed is still on the way.*

When he arrives on the first day, I introduce him to the crate by putting his toys in it. In the beginning, I've to carry him into the crate during his nap time. Later, I used his kibbles to lure him into the crate. At this point of time, I did not introduce any commands.

A way to accelerate the process, as what I have gathered from multiple resources, is to feed their meals in the crate too. I didn't want to because he used to jump on me whenever I am taking a bowl so I thought it might be better if I just get him to stay in the playpen and put the bowl outside his crate.

Within days, he understands that the crate is a space for him to sleep. After that, he started to whine when he needs to go potty. This probably indicates that he has recognised the crate as his bedroom and does not want to soil his sleeping area. I am very proud that we only had one potty accident in the crate since he has come home. That happened because I didn't understand his whining and was a bit slow in opening the crate door.

My secondary goal is to ensure that Tamago can associate crate as a place where he can feel safe and settle.

After he becomes very comfortable sleeping in the crate, I reinforce the positive association by giving him new toys and new treats in the crate. He is required to stay in the crate for a few seconds before I release the rewards. This helps to associate and reinforce the fact that "being in the crate" equal to "I get something good in return" and reduce his jumpy behaviour when he gets overly excited.

This time, I introduce a command "place". "Place" really mean to settle in a place until he's being released by me. I associated his bed as a spot to "place" but I really want him to "place" at any spot that I would want him to stay and relax. We started from the bed in the crate first because he has been conditioned very well to stay in the crate. I will most likely write about "place" in another post as this is a really useful command in conjunction with the crate training.

*Showing off that he can place on his bed anywhere now.*

There are instances that he went into the crate when he saw me taking things that he does not like (i.e. q-tips). While I might feel very frustrated that he doesn't let me clean his ears, I am quite glad that he finds crate a safe space to *hide* when he sees something that he might fear.

Nowadays, he will run back into his crate on his own during meal time and snack time to wait for me release his food. One of the first few commands that I've taught him is "Look at me", which I've added as part of the requirements before I release his rewards. The purpose is to teach him **impulse control** and **giving attention**. He tends to look at the food in the past while waiting for the "ok" command. I wanted to get his attention in overly excited situation like this and eventually generalise this in the future.

## When to remove the crate?

One of the burning questions that I had when I started crate training is... when can I remove the crate? I don't like clutter and it will be good that we can remove the crate from my room to free up more space.

When Tamago started to settle very well outside of the crate, I thought that it might be a good idea to remove it. I've put up on Carousell for sale and I'm glad that I didn't have any successful buyers.

After he came back from his neutering operation, I've to put him in the crate again. He felt so safe in the crate that he fell asleep immediately for the night.

In another instance, I realised that I've given him too much freedom in the room such that he has started to chew on my door and wardrobe. The wood splinters came out and it might pose as a risk. I've to take a step back and remove his freedom in the room.

After seeing that he can sleep so much better without distraction in his crate, I don't think I will ever remove his crate. I might remove the playpen if he stops chewing on my furniture in the room but I will still want him to settle himself in the crate.

## Summary

I think training Tamago to love his crate provides mutual benefit as I've to admit that sometimes my patience can run out when he gets very cheeky. Having a crate helps to provide a good time-out (though he barks madly sometimes) for both the owner and the dog. Furthermore, putting him in the crate ensures that he can get sufficient sleeping time with less distractions.

Tamago has been with me for about 4 months at the point of writing. I'm very thankful that I've introduced crate to Tamago and now he can stay comfortably in it without feeling that the crate is something that's used against him. It's a place that he can settle on his own and feel safe in it.
