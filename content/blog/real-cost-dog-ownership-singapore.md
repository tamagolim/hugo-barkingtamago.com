Now that I've owned a dog, I can pen down the actual cost of dog ownership in Singapore. This is meant to give a rough idea to interested parties who want to own a dog in Singapore. Price varies from store to store so I might not be getting the items from the cheapest store. Also... Tamago is a small-sized dog, the cost might be different for medium and large dogs.

## One-off Expenses

Here are the one-time expenses that I've paid so far. I masked the actual cost of purchasing Tamago since the pet shop did not put the price upfront on their profile.

### Initial Expenses and Medical

As Tamago is still young, he has not incurred any other medical expenses except for heartworm check and steralisation. If you have intention to start heartworm prevention, it will be better to consult the vet before the puppy is 6 month old. **Once they are over 6 month old, the vet will most likely advise to do a heartworm check to ensure that it's heartworm negative before the puppy starts its prevention.** Yep, that's what happened to Tamago.

| Item  | Cost | Remark |
|---|---|---|
|Cost of Buying a Dog|More than S$5000|Includes 2x Vaccination, 3x Deworm, Microchip|
|Steralisation|S$518.30|Includes blood test, drip, e-collar and medicine|
|Heartworm|S$144.70|Includes test and 1 box of NexGard Spectra|

### Environment

The "environment" items are used to puppy-proof my room. It might vary from owner to owner as the space might be very different. I am very fortunate as my cousin gave a new pet bed as a welcome gift. One way to save cost is to solict gifts from people who love your fur pal as much as you do.

### Accessories

I bought two types of leashes. The walking leash is used for normal walk while the long leash (6m) is going to be used to train off-leash recall.

Initially... I wanted to use harness on Tamago... but he's so small that the XS does not fit him at all. So I have to buy a collar (which i think it's for cats LOL) from Pet Lovers. He's using that collar ever since because of this:

*Badly fit harness might cause your furkid to escape from you...*

As for the bowls, there are a huge range of customisable, pretty and functional bowls. I used the basic metal bowls as I didn't know what to expect from Tamago when it comes to a bowl. I avoid plastic bowls as my friend warned that puppies are likely to chew and might swallow the pieces. There are also slow feeder bowls, which I am currently considering as Tamago eats really fast.

The classic Kong toy is, in my opinion, the most important toy I ever bought. I used it for several purposes: frozen banana to keep Tamago busy; hold food that might have choking hazard;

These are supposed to be one-time off expenses but of course you might need to replace them when they are worn, spoilt or too small for the fur pal. I've upgraded the pee tray because the small one is getting too small for Tamago. It's also quite common for owners to have more than 1 leash or collar for the fur pal. Hence, you might need to consider additional unbudgeted cost. **I didn't include my additional buys on leashes and collars in this table.**

##  Recurring Expenses

Then, there are a bunch of recurring expenses. These basic recurring expenses are going to last for a dog's lifetime.

### Medical

There are vaccination and pills that Tamago take every year. Drontal plus is used for deworming every 3 months (before 6 month old this should be done once a month). NexGard Spectra is used for heartworm, flea and tick prevention. Weight of the dog affects the intake. Hence, a medium or large dog will most likely incur more cost in this section.

| Item  | Cost | Recurring Period |
|---|---|---|
|Vaccination|S$37.50 per shot|Annual|
|Drontal Plus|S$3.60 per tablet|Every 6 months (1/2 tablet for Tamago)|
|NexGard Spectra|S$45 for 3 tablets|Every 3 months|

### Accessories

I will most likely upgrade Tamago's pee pad to medium size since he's using the medium-sized pee tray now. The difference between a small and medium pee pad is such that you will get 100 pcs for small-sized pee pad and 50 pcs for medium-sized pee pad with the same price. Tamago is using 2x small pee pad daily so the cost remains the same if I upgrade to medium-sized pee pad.

There are wipes that are specially made for dogs. Since Tamago did not have any skin reaction, I decided to just go ahead with normal wet wipes with no scent and no alcohol. These are used to wipe his pee, his buttock and paws after our daily walks.

Poop bags are not mandatory. I've seen owners using normal plastic bags and newspaper to pick the poo during their walks. 

| Item  | Cost | Recurring Period |
|---|---|---|
|Small Pee Pad|S$15.90|Every 1.5 months|
|Wipes|S$25|Every 4 months (20 packs)|
|Poop Bag|S$2.60|1.5 months (Estimated)|

--

### Grooming

Oral care gel is used every night. I used eye cleaner and ear rinser almost every night. Oral care gel is great but I think I will most likely get eye and ear wipes instead of using them in liquid form.

Tamago has tear stains so it's essential to clean his eyes every night. It's not excessive tearing but there are still boggles that need to be removed. Otherwise, his face will smell badly.

| Item  | Cost | Recurring Period |
|---|---|---|
|Grooming+Transport|S$95|Monthly|
|Shampoo|S$18|6 months (Estimated)|
|Eye Cleaner|S$14~|6 months (Estimated)|
|Ear Rinser|S$30~|6 months (Estimated)|
|Oral Care Gel|S$20|I've no idea how long this can last. Still on my first bottle|
|Toothbrush|S$5|Monthly|

--

### Food

Tamago is eating dry kibbles. I am intending to add freeze dried food as a topper but I've not decided on the brand yet.

| Item  | Cost | Recurring Period |
|---|---|---|
|Kibbles|S$39|Monthly (2KG - Estimated)|
|Treats & Chews|S$50|Monthly (Estimated)|

--

### Others

These are other expenses that are not in the categories listed above. 

| Item  | Cost | Recurring Period |
|---|---|---|
|Dog Ownership on AVA|S$13.50|Annual|
|Transport (GrabPet)|S$50~|Bi-weekly (Estimated)|

## Summary

Tamago has been with us for more than 4 months. If we average out the total cost excluding the cost to purchase him for the past 4 months, **I've spent around S$650 per month**. The majority of the cost comes from grooming and medical. Since we most probably won't be visiting the vet that often anymore (choy ah!), the average cost will definitely decrease over time.

*Ending this post with a cute photo*

I will most likely update this post again on his gotcha day to see if my prediction holds true.
