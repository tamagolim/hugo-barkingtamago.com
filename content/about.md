# About

Hi there! Thanks for dropping by this page!

Tamago is a Yorkshire Terrier that was born on 8th September 2020 in Singapore. We first met on 18th November 2020. It was love at first sight and the rest is history. Tamago came home on 28th November 2020 and we are having fun ever since!

As an researcher by training, I love to experiment and investigate different ways to train and bond with Tamago. I document our daily life on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/tamago.lim) but soon realised that I want a bigger space to pen down more details of our journey.

Enjoy!
