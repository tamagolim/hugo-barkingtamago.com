## Who's Tamago?

Hi there! Thanks for dropping by this page!

Tamago is a Yorkshire Terrier that was born on 8th September 2020 in Singapore. We first met on 18th November 2020. It was love at first sight and the rest is history. Tamago came home on 28th November 2020 and we are having fun ever since!

There are many great resources on YouTube and Instagram that will help first-time dog owner to kickstart with their first dog. 

As an researcher by training, I love to experiment and investigate different ways to train and bond with Tamago. I document our daily life on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/tamago.lim) but soon realised that I want a bigger space to pen down more details of our journey.

Hence, I've decided to start this blog to record our journey with more details. This blog acts as a good place to store our memories as I would really love to reminiscences our early days together as he grows older.

Enjoy!
